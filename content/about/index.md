I'm [Matei-Alexandru Gardus](https://stormhub.io). I am a student at UC San Diego
and I have been taking a shot at computer science for a while now. I like coding
various gadgets and gizmos for myself, friends or even freelance around with close
friends.

I'm a master procrastinator at heart, as this blog suggests. However, I like to
consider myself a *productive* procrastinator. In other words, I like to do
something related to a topic as a procrastinating activity.

A few examples:

* Got a project from school for CS? Never mind that, I'll read a book on machine
  learning.
* A friend asked me to make him a Raspberry Pi for push notifications? Oh yeah,
  no homework for three days!

You get the idea.
