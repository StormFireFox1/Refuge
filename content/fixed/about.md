I'm Matei-Alexandru Gardus. I am a student at "Tudor Vianu" National Computer Science High School, and I have been taking a shot at computer science for a while now. I like coding various gadgets and gizmos for myself, friends or even freelance around with close friends.

I'm a master procrastinator at heart, as this blog suggests. However, I like to consider myself a *productive* procrastinator. In other words, I like to do something related to a topic as a procrastinating activity.

A few examples:

* Got a project from school for CS? Never mind that, I'll read a book on machine learning.
* A friend asked me to make him a Rasperry Pi for push notifications? Oh yeah, no homework for three days!

You get the idea.

Currently I have two big side-projects I'm working on:

* A website to manage the class fund written in Java (I need to learn to write servers in the Java ecosystem, but it's pain)
* A journal of my journey throughout all of the programming languages I've ever used in my life, *HelloWorld*. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/StormFireFox1/HelloWorld).

Wanna stalk me on social media? I'm not too present there, but I do have a few accounts on some websites. Check out the [Contact](/contact) page.
