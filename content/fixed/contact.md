So, you'd like to get in touch with me? Yay, new friend!

I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Storm_FireFox1) account, so I guess
that's one place to try and reach me. I also have an
[e-mail](mailto:matei@gard.us) that I respond to way more frequently, so there's
that, too.

If you're a security nut, you can use
[this](/public/doc/storm_firefox1.asc) GPG public key. (ID `2FB5275E`,
Fingerprint `7A3C 6089 D16D AE3C B901  4936 5B45 E5FF 2FB5 275E`) You could also
get the public key from the GPG key servers, just use the ID above.

These are the best ways to reach me. I'll add more contact methods as time goes
by.
