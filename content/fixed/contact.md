So, you'd like to keep in touch with me? Yay, new friend! Ok, uhh...

I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Storm_FireFox1) account, so I guess that's one.
I also have an [e-mail](mailto:matei@gardus.eu), so that's one as well.

If you're a security nut, I guess you could use [this](/public/doc/storm_firefox1.asc) GPG public key. (ID `AB9B94AA`, Fingerprint `CFD7 5724 2CA6 6E85 F96B  3CDA F3D2 B830 AB9B 94AA`) You could also get the public key from the GPG keyservers, just use the ID above.

Other than that, I'm sure I'll add what more I have as time goes by. If you want my phone number, just e-mail me.
