Ok, let's just get into it!

# The Refuge

## Why did you get a blog?

I really like helping others, and I have had many people ask me what I'm working
on when it comes to side-projects. I also needed a place to sink a lot of my
time in and an excuse to procrastinate. Hence the inspiration for the name of
this blog. And since all these things blended together in a blog, I thought it
would be best to just quickly make one! And boy, was it quick. Thank god for
static site generators!

## What will you write in here?

I will write about anything on this blog, with one condition: if it's something
I'm doing to avoid doing anything else.

That is, of course, a joke. In reality, I simply enjoy doing too many things 
and just have too little time. Therefore, every once in a while, I put off other
things to try something new, and from there stems my "procrastination".

## How often will you post?

Honestly, I don't think I'll have a legitimate schedule, which is why I
recommend you subscribe to my [RSS feed](../post/index.xml) to find out when I
publish something new on my blog. If you don't know what they are, they're a
pretty old, but awesome piece of tech - check out a small introduction
[here](https://www.youneedfeeds.com/).

## What if I have some questions to ask you?

I'm thinking of integrating comments in this blog, but I'll see when I get the
time. Until then, just contact me directly one way or the other.

# Stuff about me

## How did you start getting into computer science?

I honestly don't really remember, computers have been a part of my life ever
since I was like 5. I guess you could chalk it up to "love by proximity and
time".

I will concede, however, that my oldest documented occurrence with computer
science is the creation of my GitHub account, which directly coincided with the
start of my serious work in computer science.

## What are your favorite programming languages?

My favorite languages are numerous, but my absolute favorites and most used are:

* C++
* Go
* Python
* Java
* Rust

I'm thinking about adding Haskell to that list, but I don't know about that just
yet.

## What are your favorite things to do in your free time?

There are a few things up there on my list:

* spend time on my side-projects (that was pretty obvious, look at the blog)
* listen to music and podcasts
* browse Reddit and Hacker News, and occasionally read (that's new!)
* filming skits with my friends
* filming stuff with my drone (his name is Batwing)

## Can we get familiar?

Sure we could! Hit me up with an [e-mail](mailto:matei@gardus.eu)!
