Ok, let's just get into it!

# The Refuge

## Why did you get a blog?

I really like helping others, and I have had many people ask me what I'm working on when it comes to side-projects. I also needed a place to sink a lot
of my time in and an excuse to procrastinate. Hence the inspiration for the name of this blog. And since all these things blended together in a blog,
I thought it would be best to just quickly make one! And boy, was it quick. Thank god for static site generators!

## What will you write in here?

I will write about anything on this blog, with one condition: if it's something I'm doing to avoid doing anything else.

## How often will you post?

Honestly, I don't think I'll have a legitimate schedule, which is why I recommend you subscribe to my [RSS feed](../post/index.xml) to find out when I publish
something new on my blog. If you don't know what they are, they're a pretty old, but awesome piece of tech - check out a small introduction
[here](https://www.youneedfeeds.com/).

## What if I have some questions to ask you?

I'm thinking of integrating comments in this blog, but I'll see when I get the time. Until then, just contact me directly one way or the other.

# Stuff about me

## How did you start getting into computer science?

I honestly don't really remember, computers have been a part of my life ever since I was like 5. I guess you could chalk it up to "love by proximity and time".

## What are your favorite programming languages?

My favorite languages are numerous, but my absolute favorites and most used are:

* C++
* Go
* Python
* Java
* Rust

I'm thinking about adding Haskell to that list, but I don't know about that just yet.

## What are your favorite things to do in your free time?

There are a few things up there on my list:

* spend time on my side-projects (that was pretty obvious, look around)
* listen to music
* browse Reddit and Hacker News
* filming skits with the boys
* filming stuff with my drone (his name is Batwing)

## Can we get familiar?

Sure we could! Hit me up with an [e-mail](mailto:matei@gardus.eu)!

# Wait, I know that profile picture!

Quite correct, the profile picture is not of my creation. Good catch!

For those unaware, that is the logo of SIVA, a nanovirus that debuts in the game Destiny, in the Rise of Iron expansion. Its Wikipedia entry reads:

> SIVA was once a Golden Age breakthrough in self-assembling, self-replicating nanotechnology, created by Clovis Bray to accelerate humanity's colonization effort. The technology had the ability to create nearly anything that anyone could ever need. It would be used to create new structures and colonies on new worlds faster than regular construction methods. It was considered as an amazing breakthrough in technology.

I consider a technology like SIVA's initial design a dream that humanity would definitely want to achieve. However, as you can probably imagine, SIVA
obviously didn't end up as intended in the game. Most of my projects are just random creations, much to the dismay of those around me. And since SIVA
is pretty much a creator of random things in the game, I (currently) identify with its intentions :)
