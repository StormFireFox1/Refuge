# Welcome to A Procrastinator's Refuge!

>Procrastination is defined as the avoidance of doing a task that needs to be accomplished. It could be further stated as a habitual/intentional delay of starting or finishing a task despite its negative consequences.

I like to think that that definition fits me, but in a weird little way. I have to do two things at the same time, *at all times*. As such, I commonly look like I procrastinate even though you could say I don't. In this blog, you'll find my various thoughts on whatever topic I have at hand, probably a side-project. Enjoy!
